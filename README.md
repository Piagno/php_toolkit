# PHP Toolkit

A repository with different tools for PHP, which are free to use.
Every tool is within one file, so you can easily implement it into your existing project.
Alternatively you are able to import the whole toolkit by requiring the php_toolkit.php file.

Current tools:
- feed.php - Utility to create Atom Feeds.
- html_dom.php - Utility to parse and use HTML (Source: http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net)
